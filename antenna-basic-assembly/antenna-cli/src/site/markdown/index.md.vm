# How to use ${docNameCap} from the Command Line

${docNameCap} is also available as a standalone Java jar file, enabling ${docNameCap} to
be used as a plain CLI tool. Although it is built from the same sources 
as the Maven plugin version, a few differences must be kept in mind when 
using the CLI frontend.

#[[##]]# Configuring

${docNameCap} CLI reads the same pom.xml configuration file that the Maven plugin version does.
However, the CLI understands this file only as plain XML and not as a Maven pom.
This means that some functionality provided by Maven cannot be relied upon.

Here are some pointers on writing a configuration file for ${docNameCap} CLI:

* Unlike the Maven plugin frontend, the CLI frontend won't copy the 
project's artifacts into place, so your `<filesToScanPattern>` section 
must describe the original locations of your source artifacts.

* All paths must be absolute.

* For technical reasons variables / properties containing dots will in general not be rendered correctly

    * No Maven variables can be used (except for `project.build.directory`, `project.build.outputDirectory` and `project.basedir`, since they have been added to the context).

    * Properties with a dot in them, like `${system.password}` should be changed to `${systemPassword}` in order to be rendered.

#[[##]]# Running

You can run the CLI jar file in the usual way. However, some properties
need setting up correctly before doing this. 

Here's an example shell script:
  
```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Add your configuration here
#

# Location of main ${docNameCap} jar file
${docNameAllCap}_JAR=/path/to/${docName}.jar

# Location of custom disclosure document jar file
DISCLOSURE_DOCUMENT_JAR=

# Pom.xml file for your project
POM_FILE=osmi-configuration/pom.xml

#
# Run ${docNameCap}
#

# Put these together on the classpath and run ${docNameCap}
CLASSPATH=$${docNameAllCap}_JAR:$DISCLOSURE_DOCUMENT_JAR
java -cp $CLASSPATH $${antennaCliJavaFilename} $POM_FILE
```

And the equivalent batch script:

```bat
@echo off

REM Add your configuration here

REM Location of main ${docNameCap} jar file
SET ${docNameAllCap}_JAR=c:\path\to\ ${docName}.jar

REM Pom.xml file for your project
SET POM_FILE=osmi-configuration\pom.xml

REM Run ${docNameCap}
SET CLASSPATH=%${docNameAllCap}_JAR%
java -cp %CLASSPATH% %${antennaCliJavaFilename}% %POM_FILE%
```

Alternatively ${docNameCap} can be run over the command line with this simple line:

```
java -jar path\to\ ${docName}.jar path\to\pom.xml
```
