# osm-antenna-2.0

Antenna scans artifacts of a project, downloads sources for dependencies, 
validates sources and licenses and creates:

* a third-party disclosure document that lists all dependencies with 
their licenses,
* a sources.zip containing all sources of the dependencies, and
* a processing report.

### Install and Build Antenna

##### Prerequisites
In order to be able to build antenna, you need to provide some dependencies, which are not currently on maven central:
- org.eclipse.sw360:datahandler:3.1.0
- org.eclipse.sw360:src-licenseinfo:3.1.0

Those dependencies can be build from the sourcecode of the project on [SW360](https://github.com/eclipse/sw360).

Please also note that some dependencies of SW360antenna are only available for Java 8. Hence, you will need to use Java 8 to build the project.

##### Main Install and Build

After all dependencies are present, you can build and deploy Antenna in your local repository via

<pre>
$ <b>mvn install</b>
</pre>

You can activate the following optional profiles (`build-assembly` is active by default):
- `-P build-assembly,ci`: activates also the optional profile for continious integration and includes the system tests. 
- `-P build-assembly,experimental-steps`: activates also the profile containing some experimental steps, which may still be work in progress.
- `-P '!build-assembly'`: to not build the assembly, e.g. only build the library part of Antenna.

### Configure Antenna
Antenna can be used as a Maven plugin, with  Gradle or standalone executable.
As a maven plugin, Antenna's behaviour is configured by adding a `<plugin>` to your project's `pom.xml` file and adding settings to the `<configuration>` section.
Similarly, in Gradle, the same Maven files must be given and the `build.gradle` file needs to include the Antenna configuration.
As a standalone executable, Antenna is configured as an executable jar in the command line.
Find out how to configure Antenna by reading: [How to configure Antenna](antenna-documentation/src/site/markdown/how-to-configure.md.vm).

#### Configure Antenna for Java 9 or newer
Antenna can be used with Java versions 9 or newer.
However, it requires some additional configuration described in [Tool Configuration](antenna-documentation/src/site/markdown/tool-configuration.md.vm/#additional-configuration-for-java-9-or-newer).
