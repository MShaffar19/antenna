# osm-antenna-2.0

Antenna scans artifacts of a project, downloads sources for dependencies, 
validates sources and licenses and creates:

* a third-party disclosure document that lists all dependencies with 
their licenses,
* a sources.zip containing all sources of the dependencies, and
* a processing report.

### Install and build Antenna
You need to provide some dependencies, which are not now on maven central, e.g.
- org.eclipse.sw360:datahandler:3.1.0
- org.eclipse.sw360:src-licenseinfo:3.1.0

which can be build from the sourcecode on [SW360](https://github.com/eclipse/sw360).

After all dependencies are present, you can build Antenna and deploy it in your local repository via

<pre>
$ <b>mvn install</b>
</pre>

You can activate the following optional profiles (`build-assembly` is active by default):
- `-P build-assembly,ci`: activates also the optional profile for continious integration and includes the system tests. 
- `-P build-assembly,experimental-steps`: activates also the profile containing some experimental steps, which may still be work in progress.
- `-P '!build-assembly'`: to not build the assembly, e.g. only build the library part of Antenna.

### Configure Antenna
Antenna can be used as a Maven plugin or standalone executable. As a 
maven plugin, Antenna's behaviour is configured by adding a `<plugin>` to your
project's `pom.xml` file and adding settings to the `<configuration>`
section. As a standalone executable is configured as an executable jar in the command line.
