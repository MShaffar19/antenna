# Antenna

Antenna scans artifacts of a project, downloads sources for dependencies, 
validates sources and licenses and creates:

* a third-party disclosure document that lists all dependencies with 
their licenses,
* a sources.zip containing all sources of the dependencies, and
* a processing report.

### Install and build Antenna

Please note that some dependencies of SW360antenna are only available for Java 8. So you need to use Java 8 to build the project.

If you want to build antenna without the p2 parts, use

<pre>
$ <b>mvn install</b>
</pre>

Otherwise, you can use the script `./modules/p2/prepareDependenciesForP2.sh` and afterwards call `mvn install`.
To undo this one has the script `./modules/p2/cleanupDependenciesForP2.sh`.

You can activate the following optional profiles:
- `-P ci`: activates also the optional profile for which includes the system tests. 
- `-P it`: activates also the optional profile for integration testing. 

### Configure Antenna
Antenna can be used as a Maven plugin, with  Gradle or standalone executable.
As a maven plugin, Antenna's behaviour is configured by adding a `<plugin>` to your project's `pom.xml` file and adding settings to the `<configuration>` section.
Similarly, in Gradle, the same Maven files must be given and the `build.gradle` file needs to include the Antenna configuration.
As a standalone executable, Antenna is configured as an executable jar in the command line.
Find out how to configure Antenna by reading: [How to configure Antenna](antenna-documentation/src/site/markdown/how-to-configure.md.vm).

#### Configure Antenna for Java 9 or newer
Antenna can be used with Java versions 9 or newer.
However, it requires some additional configuration described in [Tool Configuration](antenna-documentation/src/site/markdown/tool-configuration.md.vm/#additional-configuration-for-java-9-or-newer).
